This is an introductory splash screen for a yet to be made game called Trash King! It demonstrates a simple walking animation (use arrow keys) for our main character, Trash King, a greedy raccoon who has to learn how to work with others in the animal kingdom to rebuild her home. We also see our friend the bushtit.
